//Generic Types.
//Example, first pos of an array.
function getFirstPos<firstType>(arr: any): firstType {
    return arr[0];
} 
console.log(getFirstPos<string>(["First"])); //By adding the generic type in the function call, we can generate the return type.

    return obj[key];
}

//Keyof type operator.

type PointKeys = keyof Point //The type derived will be 'x' | 'y', because those are the key options.

//Typeof operator.
//Javascript gives us a typeof opperend that returns the string representation of a type.
const aTypeString: string = typeof "String";
console.log(aTypeString) //Prints 'string'
//Typescript extends the functionality with a typeof opperend that reffers to the actual typescript type.

//Indexed access types.
//We can use an indexed access type to look up a specific property on another type at a certain index.

//Using the arbitary number for arrays

//You cannot refer to types via constants.
const passionVariable = "passion" /* Bharadwaj[passionVariable] */ //Wont work.
//We can though store it in a type for a similar refactoring.
type passionTypeStore = "passion"
type usePassionTypeStore = Bharadwaj[passionTypeStore] //Works, will know we are referring to 'passion'

//Conditional types.
//Assign a type based on condtions

//Infering in condtions
type Flatten<Type> = Type extends Array<infer Item> ? Item : Type; //In our conditions we tell ts to infer the type Item exists to set the type.

//Mapped types.
//When you donâ€™t want to repeat yourself, sometimes a type needs to be based on another type.
type OptionsFlags<Type> = {
    [Property in keyof Type]: boolean; //We can map through our infered type and generate types for them like the .map function
};
//Now we can easily generate types.

//Mapping modifiers

  };
  
type LockedAccount = {

    readonly name: string;

//Template literal types.
//A simple version, generate a type using a template string.
type World = "world";

//Complex usage. Generate a variety of different strings that can be used.
